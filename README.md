I chose the pattern library, this is the tutorial: https://github.com/SYM380/p5.pattern

I first imported the pattern library into html according to his tutorial, and then downloaded p5.pattern.js and imported it. Then I learned what each line of his code controlled. The main things I try are color and position and shape transformations.

What I want is to render a capital letter "C" filled with pattern, which is the first letter of my family name “Chen”. So I changed the colors in his code so that they were different but looked like a whole, and changed the shape to form a "C" which made of squares.

I think using other people's code can quickly achieve the effect I want, but I don't dare to make changes easily, so the effects will be very similar to the original one.
